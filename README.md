# Exploring-Human-Computer-Vision-Using-OpenCV
Every system despite being powerful and complex requires man to be near it or somehow in physical contact with it for it to work efficiently. Computer vision has made it  possible to make this human-computer interaction hands free along with providing equally  efficient results. This project focuses on four such basic models that have been implemented to emphasize on the usage of image processing using well-known algorithms and classifiers. If perfected and used correctly, human computer interaction can be successfully used for wide applications
